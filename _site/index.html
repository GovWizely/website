<tr>
<td><p>Pre-Project Planning</p>
<p>We like to get involved in new projects, so we can ensure that the proper foundation is laid to increase the odds of success. We have many meeting that start with a client saying that they want a specific technology because it may be a popular buzzword. However, we focus on the business goal and then come back to the technology choices. After pre-project planning, our customers have realistic expectations and someone responsible for accepting and prioritizing work. Or, projects have been canceled after the exercise.</p></td>
<td><p>Product Development</p>
<p>We like to think of our projects as products. We want to release something to our customer’s user base as fast as we can. We achieve this by using Agile methodologies, and our clients have daily interaction with the project team to accept prioritize and / or accept work. We also use test driven development and employ third party tools that will evaluate and grade the code quality.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p>Product Launch</p>
<p>When we release a product, we want to make sure the audience uses the software. To this end, GovWizely will help with basic "marketing" tasks to make sure the end user knows about the impending solution and will be ready to use it. While we are not a marketing company, we do have some experience in getting new software to the desired audience. This immediate feedback is also important to drive the next version of the product.</p></td>
<td><p>Post-Launch Support</p>
<p>We provide maintenance and support services as needed by our customers. After a launch, we revisit our customer’s needs. We are “expendable” because we write the software in the way that anyone can take over. We have found that support is sometimes needed for non-software development functions, such as data analysts, librarians, or customer support, and we offer those support services.</p></td>

<a name="rather-drive-stick" class="anchor" href="#rather-drive-stick"><span class="octicon octicon-link" id="opensource"></span></a>Open Source</h3>

<p>GovWizely focuses in the area of data, search, and analytics. While many times those three words are thought of as separate industries, we view them all as necessary components to making data exploration easy. We will primarily use four types of tools with our projects.

# (Big) Data Software

While GovWizely embraces the trend of opening government data the word "big" may be over-utilized. We have come across customers who want to use "big data" solutions such as Hadoop when a traditional relational database would work just fine. End users do not care about back end technologies, they just want to interact with the data and get answers. 

GovWizely will bring the best possible open source solution to its customers. 

# Search Software

While the team at GovWizely has experience with a wide variety of search software solutions, recently our projects are leveraging Elastic Search for its search technology. Built to be real time and work in distributed cloud environments, it will probably be hard to get us to use something else at the current time. But, we are always open.

# Ruby

We use Ruby for our application development. 

# Web Publishing

We leverage GitHub pages for CMS free web publishing.

# SaaS Services

We will constantly educate our government clientele on the burgeoning number of SaaS services in the big data / search space. We are firm believers in leveraging SaaS services when possible. While it may be difficult in the government to get them approved, we are willing to fight the fight to help move DC IT to the present day.</p>

<a name="rather-drive-stick" class="anchor" href="#rather-drive-stick"><span class="octicon octicon-link" id="about"></span></a>About</h3>

<p>GovWizely, headquartered in Virginia, was formed to help government agencies build applications with their data. We bring modern technologies and approaches to government projects and work with our clientele to fight any bureaucratic roadblocks that may exist. The tools and approaches to software development drive the innovation in the commercial sector and we want to bring these approaches to DC. Plus, we love big data, and the government, if anything, has a lot of data.

The founders have all worked in Silicon Valley for years, but have seen retreated back to the East Coast.
