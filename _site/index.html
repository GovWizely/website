<table>
<tr>
<td><p><h3>Planning</h3>

We ensure that a proper foundation exists at the start of a project. We focus on the business goals first, and that our customers have realistic expectations. GovWizely needs a client point person to be responsible for accepting and prioritizing work on a daily basis.</p></td>
<td><p><h3>Product Development</h3>

We release software to our customer’s user base as fast as we can. We achieve this by using Agile, and our clients have daily interaction with the project team to accept and work. We use test driven development and employ third party tools that will evaluate and grade the code quality.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p><h3>Product Launch</h3>

When we release software, we want to make sure people use it! GovWizely will help with basic "marketing" tasks to make sure the audience knows about the impending solution and will be ready to use it. This immediate feedback is also important to drive the next iterations.</p></td>
<td><p><h3>Post-Launch Support</h3>

After a launch, we revisit our customer’s needs. While, we are “expendable” because we write the software in the way that anyone can take over, our projects tend to be complex. We have found that customers need non-software development functions, such as change managers, data analysts, librarians, or customer support.</p></td>

<a name="rather-drive-stick" class="anchor" href="#rather-drive-stick"><span class="octicon octicon-link" id="opensource"></span></a><center>OPEN SOURCE</center></h2>

<p>GovWizely focuses in the areas of data, search, and analytics. While many times those three words are thought of as separate industries, we view them all as necessary components to making data exploration easy.</p>
<table>
<tr>
<td><p><h3>(Big) Data Software</h3>

End users do not care about back end technologies, they just want to interact with the data and get answers. GovWizely will bring the best possible solution to its customer, whether it is Hadoop, a database, or searching flat files.</p></td>
<td><p><h3>Search Software</h3>

The team at GovWizely has experience with a wide variety of search software solutions, but lately, we primarily utilize Elastic Search.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p><h3>Ruby and CMS Free</h3>

We use Ruby for our application development and leverage GitHub pages for CMS free web publishing when allowed.</p></td>
<td><p><h3>SaaS Services</h3>

GovWizely believes in leveraging SaaS services. While it may be difficult in the government to get them approved, we are willing to fight the fight to help move DC IT to modern best practices.</p></td>

<p><p>GovWizely, headquartered in Virginia, helps government agencies build applications with their data. We bring modern technologies and approaches to government projects and work with our clientele to fight bureaucratic roadblocks. 

<p>We leverage modern tools and approaches to software development bring these approaches to DC. Plus, we love big data, and the government, if anything, has a lot of data.

<p>The founders have all worked in Silicon Valley for years, but have since retreated back to the East Coast.
