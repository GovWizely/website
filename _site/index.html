<table>
<tr>
<td><p>Pre-Project Planning</br>

We like to get involved in new projects, so we can ensure that the proper foundation is laid to increase the odds of success. We have many meeting that start with a client saying that they want a specific technology because it may be a popular buzzword. However, we focus on the business goal and then come back to the technology choices. After pre-project planning, our customers have realistic expectations and someone responsible for accepting and prioritizing work. Or, projects have been canceled after the exercise.</p></td>
<td><p>Product Development</br>

We like to think of our projects as products. We want to release something to our customer’s user base as fast as we can. We achieve this by using Agile methodologies, and our clients have daily interaction with the project team to accept prioritize and / or accept work. We also use test driven development and employ third party tools that will evaluate and grade the code quality.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p>Product Launch</br>

When we release a product, we want to make sure the audience uses the software. To this end, GovWizely will help with basic "marketing" tasks to make sure the end user knows about the impending solution and will be ready to use it. While we are not a marketing company, we do have some experience in getting new software to the desired audience. This immediate feedback is also important to drive the next version of the product.</p></td>
<td><p>Post-Launch Support</br>

We provide maintenance and support services as needed by our customers. After a launch, we revisit our customer’s needs. We are “expendable” because we write the software in the way that anyone can take over. We have found that support is sometimes needed for non-software development functions, such as data analysts, librarians, or customer support, and we offer those support services.</p></td>

<p>GovWizely focuses in the area of data, search, and analytics. While many times those three words are thought of as separate industries, we view them all as necessary components to making data exploration easy. We will primarily use four types of tools with our projects.</p>
<table>
<tr>
<td><p>(Big) Data Software</br>

GovWizely embraces the trend of opening government. However, the word "big" is often over-utilized. Some across customers want to use "big data" solutions such as Hadoop when a traditional relational database may work . End users do not care about back end technologies, they just want to interact with the data and get answers. GovWizely will bring the best possible solution to its customers. </p></td>
<td><p>Search Software</br>

While the team at GovWizely has experience with a wide variety of search software solutions, we utilize Elastic Search. Built to work in distributed cloud environments, it provides real-time answers in distributed environments.</p></td>

<tr>
<td><p>Ruby and CMS Free Application Development</br>

We use Ruby for our application development and leverage GitHub pages for CMS free web publishing.</p></td>
<td><p>Web Publishing</br>

We leverage GitHub pages for CMS free web publishing.</p></td>
</tr>
<td><p>SaaS Services</br>

We will constantly educate our government clientele on the burgeoning number of SaaS services in the big data / search space. GovWizely believes in leveraging SaaS services. While it may be difficult in the government to get them approved, we are willing to fight the fight to help move DC IT to modern best practices.</p></td>

<p>GovWizely, headquartered in Virginia, was formed to help government agencies build applications with their data. We bring modern technologies and approaches to government projects and work with our clientele to fight any bureaucratic roadblocks that may exist. The tools and approaches to software development drive the innovation in the commercial sector and we want to bring these approaches to DC. Plus, we love big data, and the government, if anything, has a lot of data.

The founders have all worked in Silicon Valley for years, but have seen retreated back to the East Coast.
