<h3>Post-Launch Support</h3>

After a launch, we revisit our customer’s needs. While, we are “expendable” because we write the software in the way that anyone can take over, our projects tend to be complex. We have found that customers need non-software development functions, such as change managers, data analysts, librarians, or customer support.
