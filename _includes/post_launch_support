We provide maintenance and support services as needed by our customers. After a launch, we revisit our customer’s needs. We are “expendable” because we write the software in the way that anyone can take over. We have found that support is sometimes needed for non-software development functions, such as data analysts, librarians, or customer support, and we offer those support services.
