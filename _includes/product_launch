Product Launch</br>

When we release a product, we want to make sure the audience uses the software. To this end, GovWizely will help with basic "marketing" tasks to make sure the end user knows about the impending solution and will be ready to use it. While we are not a marketing company, we do have some experience in getting new software to the desired audience. This immediate feedback is also important to drive the next version of the product.
