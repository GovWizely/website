GovWizely, headquartered in Virginia, was formed to help government agencies build applications with their data. We bring modern technologies and approaches to government projects and work with our clientele to fight any bureaucratic roadblocks that may exist. The tools and approaches to software development drive the innovation in the commercial sector and we want to bring these approaches to DC. Plus, we love big data, and the government, if anything, has a lot of data.

The founders have all worked in Silicon Valley for years, but have seen retreated back to the East Coast.
