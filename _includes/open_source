GovWizely focuses in the area of data, search, and analytics. While many times those three words are thought of as separate industries, we view them all as necessary components to making data exploration easy. We will primarily use four types of tools with our projects.

# (Big) Data Software

While GovWizely embraces the trend of opening government data the word "big" may be over-utilized. We have come across customers who want to use "big data" solutions such as Hadoop when a traditional relational database would work just fine. End users do not care about back end technologies, they just want to interact with the data and get answers. 

GovWizely will bring the best possible open source solution to its customers. 

# Search Software

While the team at GovWizely has experience with a wide variety of search software solutions, recently our projects are leveraging Elastic Search for its search technology. Built to be real time and work in distributed cloud environments, it will probably be hard to get us to use something else at the current time. But, we are always open.

# Ruby

We use Ruby for our application development. 

# Web Publishing

We leverage GitHub pages for CMS free web publishing.

# SaaS Services

We will constantly educate our government clientele on the burgeoning number of SaaS services in the big data / search space. We are firm believers in leveraging SaaS services when possible. While it may be difficult in the government to get them approved, we are willing to fight the fight to help move DC IT to the present day.
