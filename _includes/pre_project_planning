Pre-Project Planning</br>

We like to get involved in new projects, so we can ensure that the proper foundation is laid to increase the odds of success. We have many meeting that start with a client saying that they want a specific technology because it may be a popular buzzword. However, we focus on the business goal and then come back to the technology choices. After pre-project planning, our customers have realistic expectations and someone responsible for accepting and prioritizing work. Or, projects have been canceled after the exercise.
